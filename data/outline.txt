# Follow procedure as outlined in jupyter notebook

 1) Construct vstacked matrix
    i) Cov matrix
 2) Perform Linalg Solver
    i) Linear Algebra class
        a) Matrix Inversion - Carefull around singularity
        b) Transposition (Reuse C-code from Camb labs)
        c) Matrix Multiplication
 3) Back-testing by moving forward w rolling window 12 at a time (100 - wide)
    i) Target_return = np.linspace(0, 0.1, 21)
